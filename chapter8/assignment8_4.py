# Exercise 4: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt.
# Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line.
# For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split function.
# For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list.
# If the word is not in the list, add it to the list.
# When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

fname = input('Enter a file: ')
fhandle = open(fname)

words = list()
final = list()

#criando uma lista com as palavras do texto
for line in fhandle :
    line = line.rstrip() #retira os espa√ßos em branco
    wds = line.split() #separa a linha em palavras
#    words = words + wds

print(type(wds))
#print(type(words))

#criando uma lista sem palavras repetidas
# for word in words :
#     if word not in final :
#         final.append(word)
#
# final.sort()
#
# print(final)
