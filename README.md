My solutions to Python exercises from the book "Python for Everybody"

This file contains the solutions of some exercises from the book "Python for Everybody" (https://www.py4e.com/html3/). These exercises were selected according to the "Python for Everybody" specialization course at http://coursera.org, which I attended as a listener to improve my abilites with Python programming language.

This Specialization introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases.
